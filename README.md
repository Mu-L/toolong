# Toolong

View, tail, merge, and search log files from the terminal.


## Why?

I spent a lot of time in my past life as a web developer working with logs, typically on web servers via ssh.
I would use a variety of tools, but my goto method of analyzing logs was directly on the server with *nix tools like as `tail`, `less`, and `grep` etc.
I built `toolong` to be the tool I would have wanted back then.

## Alternatives

Toolong is not the first TUI for working with log files. See [lnav](https://lnav.org/) as a more mature alternative.
