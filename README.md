## Why?

I spent a lot of time in my past life as a web developer working with logs, typically on web servers via ssh.
I would use a variety of tools, but my goto method of analyzing logs was directly on the server with *nix tools like as `tail`, `less`, and `grep` etc.
I built `toolong` to be the tool I would have wanted back then.

## Who?

This [guy](https://github.com/willmcgugan). An ex web developer who somehow makes a living writing terminal apps.

## Alternatives

Toolong is not the first TUI for working with log files. See [lnav](https://lnav.org/) as a more mature alternative.
